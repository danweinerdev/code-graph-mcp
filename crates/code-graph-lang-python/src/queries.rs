//! Tree-sitter query patterns for Python symbol extraction.
//!
//! Validated against tree-sitter-python v0.25.0 — `PythonParser::new()`
//! returning `Ok(_)` is the gate that proves every query string compiles.
//!
//! Phase status: Phase 7.1 ships these query strings and the
//! `PythonParser::new()` compile gate. Phases 7.2/7.3/7.4/7.5 wire them
//! into per-extractor methods on `PythonParser` (definitions, calls,
//! imports, inheritance).
//!
//! ## Python-specific node-kind notes (tree-sitter-python 0.25.0)
//!
//! - **Calls use the `call` node kind**, NOT `call_expression` (which is
//!   what every other tree-sitter grammar in this workspace uses). Getting
//!   this wrong is the textbook Python tree-sitter footgun.
//! - **`async def` parses as `function_definition`**, not as a separate
//!   `async_function_definition` node. The leading `async` keyword is a
//!   sibling token of the `function_definition` (in the `decorated_definition`
//!   wrapper or directly as part of the `function_definition`'s leading
//!   children). Phase 7.2's fixture confirms this; for 7.1 we just author
//!   the query for `function_definition` and trust the grammar.
//! - **`@decorator` wraps the inner definition** in a `decorated_definition`
//!   node whose `definition` field is the `class_definition` /
//!   `function_definition`. tree-sitter queries match the entire tree, so
//!   matching the inner node directly is enough — decorator presence does
//!   NOT block extraction.
//! - **`from foo.bar import baz`** parses as `import_from_statement` with
//!   a `module_name` field of kind `dotted_name` (or `relative_import` for
//!   `from . import x`). The dependency edge points at the *module*, not at
//!   the imported symbol — `extract_imports` (7.4) reads the `module_name`
//!   field, NOT the `name` field.
//! - **`class D(B):`** parses as `class_definition` with a `superclasses`
//!   field of kind `argument_list`. Each base appears as a child of the
//!   argument_list — typically `identifier` for bare names, `attribute`
//!   for qualified bases like `module.Base`, and `keyword_argument` for
//!   `metaclass=Meta` style kwargs (which are NOT bases and are filtered
//!   out by 7.5).

/// Definition queries: top-level `function_definition` and
/// `class_definition`. The function-vs-method distinction is computed at
/// extraction time in 7.2 (a `function_definition` whose ancestor chain
/// contains a `class_definition` is a Method; otherwise it is a Function),
/// so we do not try to encode that distinction in the query string.
///
/// `async def` parses as `function_definition` in tree-sitter-python 0.25,
/// so a single query covers both sync and async forms.
///
/// Decorated definitions are reached via the same query: tree-sitter
/// queries search the whole tree, so a `function_definition` nested inside
/// `decorated_definition` matches without needing a separate pattern.

/// This is the most common mistake when authoring Python queries from

///
/// Per-pattern behavior:
/// - `(call function: (identifier))` — direct call: `foo()`. The captured

///   call: `obj.method()`, `module.func()`, chained `a.b().c()`. We
///   capture the *trailing* identifier (the field name `attribute`), so
///   for `obj.method()` we record `method`, and for chained `a.b().c()`
///   each chain link is its own `call` node and contributes its own edge
///   (one for `b`, one for `c`). This mirrors the Go selector-expression
///   handling in `code-graph-lang-go::queries::CALL_QUERIES`.
///
/// Constructor calls (`MyClass()`) are direct calls with `MyClass` as the
/// identifier — the extractor records `to = "MyClass"`. The agent is
/// expected to interpret class-named call edges as construction.
///
/// `super()` is also a direct call (To = "super"). Built-in calls (`print`,
/// `len`) likewise. Calls inside list comprehensions, lambdas, and default
/// arguments parse as ordinary `call` nodes nested under their enclosing
/// statement, so the queries match them naturally; the `from` of each edge
/// is computed by [`crate::helpers::enclosing_function_id`] in 7.3.

/// Following the Phase 6.4 cleanup that flagged dead `@call.expr`-style
